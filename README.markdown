## Welcome
This project provides an [ASP.NET MVC 5] (http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3) front-end for a 
[CKAN] (http://wiki.ckan.net/Main_Page) repository.  This project provides
a fully functioning web-based data catalog based on a group in a shared CKAN respository.

In addition, this project provides a C# wrapper for the [CKAN API Version 2][1] for developers
that want to develop .NET applications against any CKAN repository.

### About
This project was created in partnership with [Open Colorado] (http://www.opencolorado.org) and 
Colorado Smart Communities.  

This .NET implementation was created for communities that want to leverage the Colorado CKAN 
repository (http://data.opencolorado.org) while hosting a local data catalog front-end on their organization's
Windows/.NET platform.  For organizations that prefer, there is also 
a [PHP front-end] (https://github.com/opencolorado/PHP-Wrapper-for-CKAN-API) available.

There is no specific implemention in this project related to data.opencolorado.org so this can be
used with any CKAN instance.

### Live sites

The catalog is fully themable using CSS/HTML and two live sites are available:

* [Denver Open Data Catalog] (http://data.denvergov.org)
* [Town of Castle Rock Town Mapping Catalog] (http://crgov.com/index.aspx?nid=1253)

### Current Version

Version 1.12, released 8/01/2016.  For details see the [Release Notes]
